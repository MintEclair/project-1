        Greetings! My name is Mint, and this is my first web page!<br>
        I'm excited to go through this journey with you, and can't wait<br>
        to develop this site more and more!<br>
        I enjoy video games, anime, art, and music. So expect some things<br>
        like that to probably pop up here. In the meantime, here is an image of<br>
        Inosuke from one of my favorite animes Demon Slayer. <br>
